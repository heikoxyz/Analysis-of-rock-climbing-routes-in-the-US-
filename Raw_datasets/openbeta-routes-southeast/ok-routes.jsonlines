The belay ledge is about 12-15' off the ground adding to the effective height.The article describes it as a great climb on good rock in a dihedral right off the road, which is very true. It also states you wish it went on for 200' which is also true. Curt Fry, James Stuberg, and Kent S. Kaden (spelling?) share the credit for the climbs and article.
