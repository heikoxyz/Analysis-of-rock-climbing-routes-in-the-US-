Runamuck followed the arching horizontal crack from left to right, then continued up from the right side to access the attractive shallow dihedral. The dihedral was left as an unprotected runout. Prok likely went up a short time later. In keeping with traditional principles, the shallow dihedral was left unbolted. Accordingly, this climb carries an X rating.

You have to shift feet right and go from side undercling to a crimp by right shoulder. Immediately moving right hand to a similar crimp a little under shoulder width apart.
