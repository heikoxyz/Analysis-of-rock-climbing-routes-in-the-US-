It was originally called Five Easy Pieces by the first ascent party that did it as an aid climb. Sometime afterwards we started calling the route  Hyperbola and the name stuck.", "My recollection of this route is it has a very hairy first pitch that involves some thin, hairball, 5.9 Carolina slab climbing where a fall would not be good for the leader, to reach the base of the arch. To start the route you climb up on some large flakes that are below & to the left of the arch. The tricky slab climbing starts off of the flakes and heads up & right to the base of the arch crack system. Since the first ascent, a harder, but better-protected direct start has been added. Getting thru the hairy slab climbing is the psycological crux of this route.  A rest can be had afterwards at the base the crack system. Here the leader can rest & recoup for the pumpy technical crux under cling & pull-over move to reach the beautiful arching dihedral finger crack. Be sure your pro is set good before heading up here.", "On one memorable ascent, a good friend of mine, was launching out on this move when his pro pulled out while in the middle of the crux pull over. Cams were not on the market at that time and he had only placed this one hex to protect the undercling. This left nothing but the bolt on the slab as his last protection and he was caught looking at a potential 50-plus-foot ground fall. He looked down at me, trimbeling, wild eyed, like a deer caught in the headlights!! I shouted out my encouragement and sent up all the positive energy I could thru the rope that ran between us.  Shaking, scraping, and breathing like a locomotive he managed to barely pull over the crux move!! \"Are you alright Peter!!??\" I called up. After a quite a few minutes, where I think he was digesting seeing his whole life flash before his eyes, he replied \"Yea!\" He finally regained his composure and, like the true hard man he was, finished up the rest of arch.", "Most folks will rap from the top of the arch, but there are 2-3 more pitches to finish the route to the top.

It is important to recognize Ted as the name for this route was inspired by Ted and comes from a Zappa song.

The story behind that is after we did the first ascent we were telling Jeep Gaskin, Grover Cable & some other friends about the new route. They asked us how hard we thought the route was. We thought about it and it seemed pretty easy compared to some of the scarefests we had done & were doing on the Glass and elsewhere and we also thought 5.10 was about the hardest we could climb back then. So off the cuff I said \"Oh, it's probably  about 5.8.\" Future ascents later confirmed that I might have had understated the rating a bit. Hence it became dubbed \"The worlds hardest 5.8\"  Goes to show its always good to have a concensus on ratings....

This variation climbed direct up a step slab off the ground with little or no pro to below the belay below the crack. The route has some hard moves to gain the crack and that is what I thought was the crux on the FA. Continue on up the crack and belay near the top. From there move out left a bit to find a spot where you can move thru the bulges and start trending right and then up.

Probably the best line at the crag, unless you prefer slab climbing, then you will like the other routes. Steep, featured, and by virtue of being the exposed section of the arete, the rock is very clean with great texture. This route initially started as an alternate finish to the route Left Unlocked and was bolted ground up. An anchor was later added to allow lower off with a 70 (barely! Tie knots in the end of your rope) and a direct start was discovered which was bolted on rappel. Although Left Unlocked is badass, probably the best way to do this route is via the direct start as described herein.", "The route begins in the dirty corner to the left of the arete. Place good gear through about 40 feet of the crack. There is a bomber .75 camelot just before the traverse right toward the bolts on the face (double length sling recommended on the cam).", "After traversing right from the crack, gingerly mantle on top of a hollow flake (don\u2019t kill your belayer).

The route was approved by the Klub for Parity in Outdoor Participation which found the route to be of similar difficulty for all genders and races, and one member saying that it does in fact bring her joy. The route was initially bolted ground up as required by K-POP, but later a direct start was rap bolted, just to stick it to the man.
