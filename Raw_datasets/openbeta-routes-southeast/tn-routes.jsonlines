I was up there by 8am, and climbing. I hooked up with Joe, a guy who was also alone that day, at least until his pal showed up in the afternoon. Joe is a guide and instructor for a local climbing school, and knows Twall pretty well. Joe asked what routes I did the day previous to figure out what I climbed like, so he could choose some good lines for us to do. I mentioned doing \"A nastily runout 5.10+ that seemed to be more like a 5.11 to me\"  Joe said \"Was it called MEAN CUISINE?\" Apparently the route has a reputation... ", "  Joe and I warmed up on the moderate, yet sustained \"PASSAGES (5.8)\". It is a **** lovely route, about 130' tall, a must-do. Joe cruised up behind and we rapped off.  I spent some time doing some boudering and snagging a few routes before Joe and I decided to do a 5.10a dihedral called \"Margin Of Profit\" that I'd heard about.  I and Joe located it and I quickly jammed up past the first roof, then up to the second roof about 80' or 90' off of the deck.  Several people had said something about heading left out of the dihedral, and there was a big horizontal. I placed a few pieces under the roof and looked both left and right. I was getting pumped, so I hastily went left, as I thought I had been advised. Well, as I heel-hooked up and around the arete on which I had arrived I pulled myself to a spread-legged sitting position on the 8 inch ledge/corner and yelled \"I must be in the front Row!\" A few people looked up and said that I was off route, and that I should have gone right.  Standing on the ledge and looking over, I realized that they were right. There the big holds were! I was too pumped to get back down the roof, so I paced a blind nut or two and started strait up. One person yelled \"Hey, it's a new route.\" I responded (20' above my last piece, feeling pumped and on 5.10 moves) \"I'll call it 'Margin of Error' if I live. ", "  After about another 10' I got a good piece, and ran another 20' to the top. It was an awesome route, about 130-140' or more in total height. Joe trailed his rope and started up. About 10 falls later he started talking about it being a bit difficult. At the top (20 falls later?) he looked at me with saucer sized eyes and said \"That was a stout lead.\" I looked at him and responded: \"Thaths whffath I Wath Sthfinking!\"  My mouth was still a little to dry to talk correctly... ", "  John Cioci (my usual climbing partner) had arrived to see the latter half of the adventure, and pulled and coiled the ropes while I booted and packed up.

This badass route was bolted by Chattanooga stone man John Dorough during the height of Denny Cove development in early 2011. During this same season, Buffet classics such as Magic Meat, Dalai Lama, Home Cooked, Trichinosis, Mighty Quinn, Meat and Three, and really, every single other sport climb on the Buffet wall were established by the legendary Chattanooga developers John Dorough, Cody Averbeck, Stephen Farmer, Edward Yates, and Dave Wilson. At the tail end of this era in Buffet development Zach Lesch-Huey, Laban Swafford, Brent McDaniel, and Jonathan Brandt added such classics including All You Can Eat and Kids Eat Free. During this time period, first ascents were going up left and right. Some routes were flashed, some took days, and some took the season but through it all, Little Tokyo would not fall.", " For months, Laban Swafford and Jonathan Brandt would swap burns at the end of the day attempting the moves with lofty aspirations of sending Denny's crown jewel. Moves, sequences, and bolts of climbing would surrender to their efforts but it wasn't until the South's prodigal son, Ronnie Jenkins, returned for a visit that the crux move would finally fall - an elevator door move involving a one pad, three-finger, right hand gaston and a high left foot to a left hand gaston edge high above and behind the right hand. Thought to be a V9 move in isolation, Laban and Jonathan desperately tried to share in Ronnie's isolated success but to no avail. Little Tokyo would not yield!", " Seasons flew by and Little Tokyo saw little attention beyond the duo's whole-hearted but half-juiced attempts at small links. Draws faded, cobwebs grew, and dreams of sending dissolved until the country's largest climbing fundraising event in the country's largest indoor gym kindled a flame and one individual proved worthy.", " On February 23, 2013 local climber Tyler Willcutt attended the Rock n' Rave event at Stone Summit Climbing Gym in Atlanta, GA. Over the years, the event drew in big names such as Sasha Digulian, Dave Graham, and Tommy Caldwell but at the very first event, Chris Sharma himself graced the South with his presence. \"What does this have to do with Little Tokyo?\", you may ask. Actually, it has everything to do with Little Tokyo.", " On February 24, 2013, the day after Rock n' Rave, Tyler Wilcutt was visiting Denny Cove for the first time with Laban Swafford. The pair warmed up and Laban gave a burn on the Little Tokyo. Tyler asked Laban if he could give it a try. While Laban had put a great amount of effort into Little Tokyo, it wasn't his route to close so of course Laban obliged and Tyler took off on his first attempt of the project. Well, Tyler looked like shit on it. Cruxes that felt easy to Laban felt impossible to Tyler and very few links were made. Tyler lowered with no expectations and a whole host of new opinions on the difficulty and quality of this route. It was hard, and it was awesome. When it came time for Tyler to climb again, he asked Laban if he could give it another go. Seeing as how his first go was a total turd of an attempt, Laban had absolutely no issue...but there was one thing Laban didn't know.", " When Tyler left the ground for his second attempt on Little Tokyo, he was in a very different mindset than any he had been in before. See, it was rumored that Sharma would be visiting Denny cove the day after his trip to Atlanta. What would you do with this information? Well, Tyler took it and said to himself \"If I'm on route and Chris Sharma walks around the corner, I better be trying my ass off.\" Would you be okay with Sharma standing at the base of your project watching you half-ass your way through all the moves? Nope, and neither was Tyler. Now, it's totally ridiculous to think that the most legendary figure in climbing history would ever show up to the choss-fest that is the Buffet Wall, but Tyler didn't know that. He launched onto the route with more Dura than he ever had given any route before.", " Fast forward a few minutes and Tyler is back on the ground next to Laban. Both of them in utter disbelief. Tyler had just sent second go. He hadn't even done all the moves the first time. WTF. Both of them were shocked. The power of the Dura is real. Little Tokyo was complete.", " And there you have it, the story of the first ascent. In the seasons that followed, the route was repeated only a couple times by climbers Brion Voges and Jonathan Brandt. Now it's 2018 and in the past season or two Little Tokyo has seen numerous ascents including its First Female Ascent by Kim Shelton and is earning its well-deserved reputation as one of the best in Chattanooga.", " Regarding the breakdown, it's nearly impossible to talk beta, grades, or cruxes with fellow climbers since they all vary wildly depending on who you ask. The route begins with 20 or so feet of 5.12+ climbing to a jug. From there, you launch into three stacked boulder problems (one crimpy, one powerful, one tricky) that culminate in 5.11+ climbing to the chains. Opinions on the difficulty of each of these boulder problems range from V5-V8 depending on who you ask. Originally thought to be 5.14a by Laban and Jonathan, Tyler's ascent dubbed the route 13c (although he listed 8b on 8a.nu to not hurt anyone's feelings) and subsequent ascensionists have graded the route anywhere from hard 13c to hard 13d. In 2016/2017 a non-crucial undercling broke between the first and second crux.

It wasn't a crux hold and it was questionable as to whether or not it affected the integrity, quality, or difficulty of the climb. Many climbers weighed in on whether or not to glue the hold back on. Knowing the route well, I was confident the route would still go...so I returned to the route, completed the new sequence, and walked away with the broken hold.I didn\u2019t do this because I was involved in the late stages of development of Cobra Pimp or because I got the FA. I did it because, if we're fighting the natural evolution of a climb, then why are we climbing outside in the first place? If the climber maintains or restores a route to their personal standard of quality and desired difficulty, then what more is that route than a gym climb? I can't say where all the lines should be drawn, but I can say that I climb outdoors to discover, experience, and explore natural movements - not man made ones. This is why I was adamant the \u201coriginal\u201d Cobra Pimp not be restored. A new, quality sequence existed, the route goes at a similar grade, and new challenges have been presented.\u00a0At some point, many of us may be faced with a similar decision. The only guidance we have in making this decision is in asking ourselves \u201cWhy do I climb?\u201d I climb because I love the movement and am addicted to the challenge. I climb indoors because there is near unlimited potential for creative, man-made movements to explore. I climb outdoors seeking the same thrill of movement but on natural stone, in a natural environment, with natural, discoverable, unique sequences. I like keeping these two separate because, if I didn\u2019t, I may as well just save myself the gas.In April 2021, I resent Cobra Pimp, dubbing the new version Cobra Prime - a cleaner, more quality product than what existed previously. This will almost certainly not be the last evolution of the route but it currently exists in a high quality state that is worthy enough to test some of the South's strongest. It is a true fitness, power, and technical masterpiece that demands everything from the climber - a true anomaly in the South and one of its best rock climbs. I believe the grade is more in the realm of 14a but can see how it\u2019s so specific in size and style that it may feel harder for many others. These points may be generous, but be honest and you be the judge. The route is deserving of the attention.\u00a0___The love child of Psychopath, The Pinch (7b soft), and Simply Read.
