From here,  ascend a difficult, near vertical face, that culminates in an easier chimney, back to the ridge crest.  Apparently Beckey's party traversed the gendarme to the north using a bit of aid, and the AAJ indicates this obstacel will go free at 5.9 if the rock is dry & free of snow.   ", "  The second crux entails opvercoming a short, steep headwall (fixed gear may be present here) that is downright tricky when the mossy rock is wet.  Traverse right (north) under the wall, turn an exposed corner, then lead up a shallow ramp to a short step (mantle). ", "  The final crux requires surmounting a near-vertical 30' face that climbs out of the \"Rappel Notch\".  Once this obstacle is surmounted, traverse right around the obvious wave-shaped fin on steep slabs on the north face.  Continue on easing terrain to the 'a chavel' summit block. ", "  To Descend, reverse the route to the \"Rappel Notch\".  Around 4 60m rappels will reach the Hog's Back.  Descend to the Bergschrund, where one more rappel (from the lowest rock outcroppings) may be required to reach easier terrain below the 'schrund, and the short slog back to camp."], "protection": ["Full alpine kit.

To summit: Todd Bibler/Doug Klewin in 1983.", "description": ["---------- HISTORY ---------- ", "  In a range full of incredible mountains and world class routes, the North Buttress of Mount Hunter is perhaps the most iconic stage for cutting edge alpine triumphs. ", "  This 6,000' bastion of ice and stone is painted with an exceptionally unique history. Starting in the mid 1970s, a number of the world's foremost alpinists began attempting to climb the North Buttress of Mount Hunter. Most attention was focused on the obvious ice couloir that would later be known as the French Route. ", "  In 1980, a team of strong climbers from the Pacific Northwest, known as the White Punks on Dope (Doug Klewin, Rob Newsom and Pat and Dan McNerthney), made significant progress on what is now commonly referred to as the Moonflower or Bibler/Klewin route. Poor weather forced them off after forging nearly a dozen pitches through several low cruxes to the First Ice Band. For several years prior, they had attempted other potential routes on the North Buttress, even making it to the top of the North Buttress Couloir before breaking their picks in the bullet hard ice. Newsom recalls Bibler and Klewin glassing the Buttress from the base while \"stoned out of their minds.\" Bibler had spotted a line of ice runnels connecting directly to the Prow, up through a series of ice hoses and potentially involving some pendulums through the third rockband (Vision).  ", "  The team returned in 1981. This time dressed all in black, they called themselves Back in Black. While climbing to the Prow. Mugs Stump flew in with New Zealander Paul Aubrey and pushed a line slightly right of their original start.  While the Back in Black team descended to repair a broken portaledge, Mugs and Aubrey surpassed them on the Prow and continued upward through virgin terrain. Newsom was particularly frustrated since he had shown Mugs slides of their proposed route the previous year. Back in Black descended as ice rained down upon them from Mugs. In basecamp, Rob Newsom exclaimed that watching Mugs and Aubrey climb high on the Buttress was \"like having your girlfriend stolen from you.\" ", "  Several days later, Mugs and Aubrey climbed through the final rockband at 12,000 feet, to the end of the major technical difficulties. Although 700' separated them from the top of the North Buttress itself and more than 2,500' separated them from the North Summit of Mount Hunter, they claimed a first ascent and rappelled to basecamp. To this day, some credit Mugs Stump and Paul Aubrey with the first ascent. ", "  In 1983, Todd Bibler and Doug Klewin returned yet again. In the finest of styles, they climbed the North Buttress of Mount Hunter to the summit, using their original start. Their integral ascent to the top of the mountain is, and should rightly be, credited as the true first ascent. ", "  To crown the early history of the North Buttress, Rob Newsom and Pat McNerthney finally climbed the route to the summit for its second complete ascent in 1984. McNerthney brilliantly free-climbed the Shaft, a 400' chimney of dead vertical and overhanging ice that is the route's crux. The integral ascents to the summit by Bibler, Klewin, Newsom and McNerthney stand as an unarguable testament to their enduring determination and a standard that every alpinist should seek to emulate. ", "  As of 2013, there are more than half a dozen routes on the North Buttress of Mount Hunter. Less than 30 teams have taken any of those routes to the summit of Mount Hunter.", " ---------- ROUTE ---------- ", "  The Moonflower (Bibler/Klewin) is comprised of many different cruxes, all with their respective names. To understand the route as a whole, it is imperative to appreciate the individuality of each of these parts. ", "  -Start: Original (WPOD) or Mugs   -The Prow   -Tamara's Traverse   -The Shaft   -The Vision   -The Bibler/Come Again Exit", " -----START----- ", "  From the base of the North Buttress, there are two distinct starts. The Original (WPOD Start) begins on an ice apron to the left of a major rock scar. This ice apron is melting at an alarming pace and the bergeshrund is increasingly hard to surmount. More and more rock is exposed and sections of the original start (Klewin couloir) have disappeared after a massive piece of the lower Buttress collapsed in the early 2000s. Climb over the airy 'schrund (in the past few years people have resorted to picket aiding, as it has become wider and steeper), then climb up and right on the ice apron for several pitches to the base of the Twin Runnels. Climb several pitches of ice up to WI4, through the Leaning Ramp (M5) and to the base of the Prow.", " In good years, the Mugs Start is a dramatically easier and quicker alternative. Well right of the original start, surmount the burgeschrund and veer up and left on snow and ice around fingers of rock. Climb moderate mixed terrain for six to eight pitches to the narrow snow apron beneath the Prow. Traverse left one full pitch to the base of the Prow.", " -----THE PROW----- ", "  The Prow is an unmistakable feature on the North Buttress. This gigantic sail of granite juts out from the wall and is easily visible from anywhere low on the route. Climb a short and steep bit of thin ice or rock to the corner of the Prow. Using a mixture of aid and free climbing (it can be entirely free-climbed at M7), torque and scratch your way up, keeping an eye out for a fixed piton or two. Eventually a hanging blob of ice will provide some relief. Climb to the top and belay. Look for an old bolt in the rock above you. This will be your pendulum point to the incredible McNerthney Ice Dagger. This two pitch vein of moderate and fun ice is one of the easier pitches on the route. Take a moment to appreciate the amazing setting, but climb quickly as there is a notorious hanging snow mushroom that looms above. Climb through a few steps until you reach a rock headwall.", " -----TAMARA'S TRAVERSE----- ", "  Tamara's Traverse may be the most iconic pitch on the whole route. Named after Rob Newsom's wife, this 150' lateral pitch averages 80 degrees and features an assortment of ice and mixed moves. Protection is generally quite good and, despite the unrelenting exposure, it is not incredibly difficult. Take a quick look beneath your feet while crossing and you will surely feel like you are flying. This pitch is as exposed for the second as the leader, so protect it wisely. Another pitch of easy ice will put you at the base of the First Ice Band. Climb up and left for several pitches and chop out a bivy here. This will be the last spot for a bivy until you pass through the Shaft and reach the Second Ice Band.", " -----THE SHAFT----- ", "  Two mixed pitches (the second being fairly challenging) will deposit you at the base of the route's notorious crux, the Shaft. Take notice of another \"death mushroom\" looming above the second pitch and be careful not to touch it as you climb past. Steve Mascioli was killed when this mushroom fell on him. The Shaft is an otherworldly 400' chimney of ice that is anywhere from three to six feet wide. Dead vertical ice is broken by several short sections of overhanging ice. Excellent rock on the walls of the Shaft often provide opportunities for bomber protection, taking some of sting out of the sheer and sustained difficulty of these pitches. The Shaft can be climbed in two rope stretching pitches or as three shorter pitches. A rappel anchor on the left side of the wall can serve as a good belay anchor, although it is a hanging stance. At the top of the Shaft, a short, non-technical pitch will land you at the Second Ice Band. At the apex of this small Ice Band, it may be possible to chop out an easy ledge from snow (instead of ice, as is necessary at the First Ice Band). This will be your last opportunity to comfortably rest and brew up before reaching the top of the Third Ice Band.", " ----THE VISION----- ", "  Another full mixed pitch puts you at the infamous pendulums of the Vision, another of the Moonflower's well-known cruxes. Certain topos show two pendulums, but in certain conditions it may be possible to only do one. Pendulum left and gain a steep, mixed gully to the base of an ice-choked left slanting crack. Occasional fixed gear and a few moves of A0/A1 will help throughout the mixed battle through the steepest part of the Vision. Eventually you will be spit out at the base of a narrow, low angle ice gully. Belay here and then climb an incredible and moderate pitch up and right toward the base of the Third Ice Band. Another low angle ice pitch will wind you around some rocks, past rappel slings. Make the long trudge up the Third Ice Band, looking for an obvious weakness in the Final Rock Band up and right.", " -----THE BIBLER/COME AGAIN EXIT----- ", "  The Bibler/Come Again Exit has been labeled as an M5 off width. Other times it may be choked with ice and therefore significantly easier. From the top of the Third Ice Band, several moderate mixed and ice pitches arc up and right towards this feature. Above the Exit, 700' of soul crushing, calf destroying, iron hard 50-degree ice leads to the top of the Buttress and the Cornice Bivy at 12,700'.", " -----TO THE SUMMIT/DESCENT----- ", "  From the Top of the Bibler/Come Again, you have multiple options. Most teams who make it to this point decide to rappel the route as \"they have reached the top of the technical difficulties.\" Some continue upwards to the Cornice Bivy and the top of the Buttress. Weather and conditions allowing, a hearty few have the tenacity and fortune to make a summit attempt.  ", "  The final 2,000' cross low angled, avalanche prone slopes. Assess conditions and plan accordingly. If you reach the summit, take a long moment to ponder the descent options. Retracing the same slopes and rappelling 4,500' is no small affair. Combine that with the fact that you may be mentally drained and dealing with stuck ropes (8-12 hours from buttress top). A very viable option is to descend towards the West Ridge and drop down the Ramen Couloir. This in itself is also no small affair, as it also involves serious route finding and avalanche slopes. One benefit however is the virtual absence of necessary rappels.  ", "  Descend the West Ridge past the high camp. traverse towards the steep pinnacled crest and locate the entrance to the Ramen Couloir. A small hanging glacier just barely misses the Ramen Couloir. Make several low angle rappels in to the couloir and downclimb to the valley floor. Look for a prominent hump on the right that bypasses the Ramen Icefall. Ascend the hump and wrap around, looking for a rappel anchor that deposits you in to a claustrophobic ice cleft. Make two more rappels to the bottom and hike to the valley floor. All that separates you from the food piles and whiskey at basecamp is a several hour hike around the West Ridge on the Kahiltna. In good conditions, it has taken roughly 12 hours to reach base camp from the summit of Hunter via this option.", " ----------FINAL THOUGHTS---------- ", "  The Bibler/Klewin is one of the most coveted climbs in the entire world. Do not underestimate its severity, but do not be afraid to go up for a recon. Everyone climbs the Mini-Moonflower, hoping to train for the real thing. Go \"crag\" the start of the Bibler/Klewin to the base of the Prow. This will familiarize you with the route and your conditioning.  ", "  Every season, a number of teams stack up around basecamp, vying for the Bibler/Klewin. The route has developed a sort of political nature, with certain teams trying to dictate when and how it should be climbed. Be prepared for some minor bullshit, or just go for it. ", "  Good luck.

Good pro. There is a obvious hanging belay out right of the corner that can be skipped to reach a small stance up and left. From here the second pitch of the spiral continues up, first left and eventually back right. The moves are powerful but there are bomber constricting slots in the cracks for tools, and plentiful fixed pins. this pitch can be run to a good ledge below the Bastion. From this belay a short traversing rightward pitch leads to the base of a 5.9 chimney. The chimney pitch has an awkward chockstone near the top, leading to a fixed belay. The next few pitches are easier mixed climbing over rock, M4ish, getting progressively easier until the fantastic bivi/brew spot at the base of Nose.

Simuling is most likely faster, as when the leaders calves explode upon reaching the boulder they can put the second on belay, allowing for a much more rapid following pace to be implemented. Three pitches off the Boulder gets you to the ridge crest. Be wary here, as the other side is a massive cornice that drops 5000 feet to the West Fork of the Ruth. Traverse right along the ridge on steep snow (the flat part is a cornice) until the ridge broadens and feels secure enough. There is a short 40 or so foot ice step in the ridge that must be surmounted before easy walking to the summit. Enjoy the fleeting feeling of success before beginning the massive (but relatively straightforward) descent. ", "  To get down, reverse the ridge and begin rapping. Our first anchor was a bollard, after which we reached the ice and made V threads, basically heading plumb vertical, trending ever so slightly skiers right. Don't follow the way you came up, instead rap into the rock overhanging the top of the West Face Couloir. Once you get to the rock there are fixed anchors to follow that dump you right into the WFC. In the couloir it's around 6 or 7 200 foot raps of v threads, then more raps of rock anchors. Eventually you reach a big 50 degree snow face that probably could be downclimbed. When we got there we had been on the go for 22+ hours and decided to make bollards. 5 or so bollards got us down past the schrund.

While on the glacier, the Stump appears tiny next to all of the giants that surround it. The route being \u0093only\u0094 12 pitches long, I thought that this thing was going to be a quick romp up the granite.  In addition, in preparation for this route, one of my partners and I climbed several routes in Red Rock of similar length, one of which had a similarly difficult crux pitch.  I know what you are going to say, Red Rock is softly graded, and that anyone who climbs there has no sense of what things should be rated.  However, I found the grades on Goldfinger to make sense, if you know what I mean.  However, in the end 2000 feet is 2000 feet and it takes most of us weekend warriors a while to climb. ", "  We tried to get up this thing three times, and succeeded on the third try.  Good weather and good route conditions are tough to catch.  Another party had tried this route a day or two before our first attempt, and made it up to the top of pitch 10 before being turned back by too much snow up near the summit.  Our first try, we started too late in the day and got stormed off.  The second try, the next day, we ran into too much water on the 3rd pitch to continue.  We rested a day and then got up at 4am to beat the heat on the route and made it to the top.   ", "  Our numerous tries gave me a few insights that I will share throughout this description.   ", "  There are two ways to start this climb.  The first way would be to go straight up the obvious corner feature that makes up the majority of this route.  However, in a heavy snow year like this one, it makes more sense to start to the left of the corner where some easy climbing will lead you to a ledge.  While we were there, a slung block at the left edge of the ledge helped mark where to go.     So starting from the snow at the base of the ledges, the climb went something like this for us.   ", "  Side note:  all belays are fixed, usually consisting of a combination of wires, pins and slung features.  There is one bolted station.  Bring a knife and extra webbing or cord to back up belays.     p0 (approach to ledges):  Climb up steep snow in your ski boots (a belay is sensible as there is a moat hidden under the snow that could swallow you up) to just below the rock.  Fiddle in some pro, and switch to your rock shoes.   (On our first two tries, we climbed this part in our ski boots.  While it is doable, I preferred the ease and speed my rock shoes gave me on this section.)  Climb up to the rap sling around a horn, and from this ledge, go up to the next larger ledge about 5 feet higher.  ", "  Once on this ledge you can ditch your boots, and whatever extra gear you may not be trying to take up the route with you.     Now the route really begins.   ", "  p1:  We did this pitch two different ways.  The first day we traversed right across big easy holds to get to the main corner, where fun easy climbing led to a roof at about 80 feet up.  At the roof head left toward a slung flake (rap station, or intermediate belay)  avoiding some corner sections with no pro.  From a little bit above the slung flake, head back toward the corner and continue until you reach the belay station.  ", "  or ", "  From the approach pitch ledge, go straight up obvious cracks that are on the right hand side of the ledge which lead to the slung flake mentioned above, continue as above.  (5.8, 170ft from approach ledge) ", "  p2:  Apparently you can take the right hand side of the pillar that sits in the middle of the main corner system at 5.9 wide, but we chose to go on the left hand side.  This pitch was killer.  From below this pitch looks steep and improbable, with the right side of the corner looking devoid of feature, and the left hand side too steep to be helpful.  However, occasional good footholds show up on the right hand side, and on the left, tons of awesome hand holds show up just when you need them.  I thought that this pitch was going to be a layback extravaganza, but it ended up being a thoughtful combination of stemming, layback and face climbing, with plentiful gear. (5.9, 170ft) ", "  p3:  We got turned back at this pitch twice, once due to clouds of impending doom, and once because the pitch was coursing with water (from the previous day\u0092s clouds of impending doom).  However, this pitch never seemed to be dry, but thanks to plentiful face holds the pitch is surprisingly climbable in through the moisture.  Lots of gear is available and there is a pin about 40 feet up the pitch from which you can retreat if you\u0092ve had enough.  Once you\u0092ve made it through about 60-70 feet of watery corner climbing you will be coming to a series of roofs in the corner.  Just below the second roof, climb left across a series of face holds to reach another corner.  From here continue up the corner to a belay.  This pitch was rated on the topo at 10b, but we found it to be more like 5.9 even in the wetness. (5.10b/5.9, whatever, 200ft) ", "  p4:  Continue up the corner with more great climbing and good pro.  The top of this pitch ends at a very comfortable ledge.  Up until this point all of the other belays had been at small ledges for stances.  We had been leading in blocks, so we found this ledge to be a great place to let the next leader cast off.  (5.9/200ft) ", "  p5:  From the nice big ledge, scramble around to the right on easy terrain, and then back left into the corner, the belayer won\u0092t really be able to see the leader for the first 60 feet, but since this section is about 5.0, it isn\u0092t that big of a deal.  However, a little higher on the pitch, gear gets a little sparse and the climbing gets a little tough so don\u0092t let the first half of the pitch lower your guard.  (5.9/170ft) ", "  p6:  This next section of wall is complex, and there are many options.  Here is what we did.  Climb up the corner for about 100 feet, once here traverse right, toward the ar\u00eate.  Just before you get to the ar\u00eate, some cracks/seams head up to the belay.  The member of our team who was leading this pitch thought they looked devoid of pro from below, and therefore went around the ar\u00eate and up through some less than pleasant climbing, with marginal pro.  Upon inspection on rappel, we determined that these cracks took lots of gear, so climb them.  Here, we had to simul about 5 feet.  I think that we had long 60m ropes, on many of the pitches labeled 200feet on the topo we had a 10-15 feet of rope left.  So if your ropes are short 60s you will be doing more simuling here. (5.9/205ft) ", "  p7:  From the belay traverse up and right, heading for interesting stemming on large vertical flakes that remind me of climbing the inside of a door frame.  Once past this section, head right and up, toward several options for vertical cracks, and small corners with cracks making it difficult to describe our path.  In fact, I think I climbed it differently than the leader, because I kept having to traverse here and there to get his gear out.  There are supposed to be some \u0093easy ledges\u0094 out to the right in the final third of the climb. I didn\u0092t necessarily find them easy, but no harder than anything else on the pitch.  (5.9ish, 200ft) ", "  p8:  This is where I took over the lead, so my recollection of the quality of the gear placements and handholds might become a little clearer.  My first thought on heading up for my first lead of the day was that there were no 5.8 handholds, and no easy placements.  Cruising on top rope all day had numbed my mind a bit.  I felt like the pitch was a bit tricky all the way to the belay, starting with some discontinuous cracks running through some slabs.  Once here, look for some gear in a flake out to the left, and head up and kind of right onto a slab on a left facing pillar.  I paddled up to the bottom of the hanging flake whose left side forms the layback crux on the next pitch.  I set an anchor in the bottom of the hanging flake with a few tight hands to rattly fingers sized pieces.  (5.8/120ft). ", "  p9:  The crux pitch.  The climbing starts off with a layback up the left side of the hanging flake that gradually goes from rattly fingers down to fingers and then ends in a seam.  Out on the left face the occasional good foothold, and many pretty good footholds appear with the occasional smear; rest stances show up periodically as do plentiful gear options.  Once at the seam, traverse to the left under the roof, a few placements appeared where I wasn\u0092t expecting them.  Here at the roof, good handholds and the occasional good foothold show up.  Go up the next corner for about 10 feet to an anchor made of a few nuts and a red C4 camalot.  (5.11a, 100ft.)  I would think some hard climbers would be able to link 8&9 with a 70m.   ", "  p10:  This pitch is an amazing stemming corner, with interesting moves and sustained moves all the way to about 120-150 feet.   From here the climbing eases and the corner leads up another 30 feet to where it tops out on a very gravelly ledge.  Here I took out my nut tool and mined an anchor out of a muddy crack.  There are two or three kind of cracks in rounded corners, I\u0092m pretty sure I picked the right most one.  Be careful here as there are a lot of fist-sized rocks sitting in a pile of pea gravel which can be easily knocked onto the belayer.  There is a rappel anchor made of a couple of slings threaded between two rocks leaning together about 20 feet up, that could be used for the belay.  I had enough rope drag to make me hesitant and the right pieces to build my anchor so I chose that option.  (5.10a, 180ft.) ", "  p11.  From here it becomes a choose your own adventure type of thing.  Here the obvious solid cracks and corner pitches give way to short stepped sections with many variations.  I went up from the belay on crumbling feet through the rounded corner to a flat slightly gravelly ledge,  where I went up to a corner system.  There was no crack to speak of in the corner system, but there was a crack running up the edge of the left side.  Here I found a belay on the next low angle dirty ledge system in between a  vertical flake and a wall.  (200ft including horizontal walking sections/5.moderate weird mountain stuff) ", "  p12.  Here we went up and slightly right to a wide corner formed by two large boulders near each other.  Stemming  up through this section of mellow climbing until you reach a small roof feature, traverse right and top out (150ft? with 100ft of horizontal walking/5.easy weird mountain stuff) ", "  From here we unroped and scrambled a few more feet of jumbled large blocks that form the summit."], "location": ["This route is located on the left side of the south face of the Stump.

The typical approach follows the trek up the West Buttress boot track on the Kahiltna Glacier, from its Base Camp airstrip on the Southeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier, to its Advanced Base Camp at 7,800 feet, and then up the Northeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier to the base of the route at a prominent couloir on the east side of the ridge.  You may wish to first cache food and fuel at the West Buttress camp at 14,000 feet, for use on the descent.  Alternatively you can ascend the West Buttress to 14,000 feet, climb up to a high camp on the West Rib at 16,300 feet, and ascend the balance of the route from there.  This alternate route is nicknamed the Upper West Rib, or the Riblet.  Regardless of the line that you choose, plan to spend about 21 days climbing and descending this route, beginning with your arrival at the Base Camp airstrip. ", "  Hazards on this route include crevasses on the approach from the West Buttress Base Camp airstrip, and a thick field of deep crevasses and steep ground at the mouth of the Northeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier.  The crevasses at the mouth of the Northeast Fork frequently turn West Rib aspirants away altogether.  After you've entered this valley, objective dangers in the Northeast Fork include more crevasses, steep ground, and avalanche and ice fall, particularly after heavy snowfall.  The Northeast Fork is nicknamed The Valley of Death because a team vanished here in 1981, and avalanches can sweep across the bottom of the valley after heavy snow storms.  Be alert in the Northeast Fork and choose your line, your camps, and the timing of your travel in this valley carefully so as to avoid obvious crevasse, avalanche and ice fall hazards.  The top section of the route, the notorious Orient Express, has been the scene of a number of fatalities over the years, including deaths among several Asian teams, for whose accidents the Orient Express is named.  Conditions on the Orient Express will likely include bullet proof hard packed snow and difficult to detect slabs of wind deposited snow.  These conditions make it virtually impossible to self arrest if you lose your footing and fall.  The top of the mountain, particularly above 19,000 feet, is frequently the scene of extremely high winds and bitterly cold temperatures.  Last, but not least, altitude can severely affect the health of your team, particularly since many teams ascend this route quickly, allowing little time for acclimatization. ", "  The West Rib consists of, first, the initial couloir between 11,100 and 13,300 feet on the east side of the bottom of the ridge, with 40 to 50 degree snow and ice and, potentially, a section of steep mixed snow, ice and possibly rock at the top of the couloir.  Above this couloir, the climbing between 13,300 and 16,300 feet includes steep snow and icy domes with angles up to 50 degrees.  Following lean winters, as was the case in Spring 2007, the climbing below 16,000 feet may include slopes of rotten ice. ", "  Between 16,300 feet and 18,000 feet, the route follows a line through several rock bands.  In years past, the lower part of the first rock band was a steep snow climb.  In May 2007, the first rock band had tens of feet less snowpack than it had in the mid-1990's and there were fixed lines in a narrow couloir of mixed snow and ice between 16,500 and 17,000 feet.  The second rock band consists of relatively low angle scree with a small amount of 4th class mixed snow and rock climbing. ", "  At about 18,000 feet, the route steps from the very top of the second rock band onto the upper reaches of the Orient Express.  Climb up and left via the leftmost fork of the Orient Express to lower angle snow at its top.  Be very careful on the Orient Express.  A fall here within a roped team may drag the entire team to their death due to difficulty of stopping a fall on the steep angle and firm snow on this part of the route, particularly if the team is roped together but climbing without anchors - a common approach to climbing the Orient Express in order to reach the summit (and then descend) as quickly as possible.   ", "  From the top of the Orient Express, traverse up and left on snow, below and around the north end of the final rock band above, and onto the Football Field at 19,200 feet.  Contour across and somwhat up the Football Field to the West Buttress boot track, which is typically marked with wands.  Note that early in May, prior to the first ascents of the season by guided teams, you may find that these wands have been snapped off close to the ground or they may be missing altogether, a common result of the ravages of the typically fierce winter weather upon wands installed the previous year.  Follow the West Buttress boot track to the summit ridge and then the summit.  Be very careful on the summit ridge, particularly in windy conditions, so as to avoid a long, long, long (fatal) fall down the south side of the mountain. ", "  Descend via the West Buttress, first to its 17,300 foot high camp.  Beware on the descent - As may be the case for the wands on the Football Field, although there may ordinarily be fixed pickets on the dangerous traverse below Denali Pass, these pickets may be missing during the early part of the season.  Alternatively, descend from the Football Field via the Orient Express to a convenient high camp on the West Rib at 16,300 feet.  From that high camp you can descend to the 14,000 foot West Buttress camp, and from there you can descend via the West Buttress to the Base Camp airstrip at 7,000 feet.  In lean years, as was the case in May 2007, the descent from 16,300 feet to the West Buttress camp at 14,000 feet may cross a half dozen significant crevasses on occasionally steep ground."], "location": ["The southwest side of Denali, above the Northeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier."], "protection": ["Pickets, ice screws, ice axes etc.  Rope for both glacier travel & technical steep snow & alpine ice.

Under such conditions, two tools in overhead traction (swinging) position would have added much security.  After pulling over these bulges on approx 70 degree neve, the angle would usually relent back to 45 degrees, until the next bulge was encountered.

It is possibly the only ascent of the wall. The wall itself is just over 3,000 ft elevation at the top. The climb involves a steep approach through trees and brush to a nice ledge system at an elevation of 800 ft.. From the ledge, the granite wall has what looks to be a large crack straight up to the top. The lower section of granite has 4 pitches of moderate 5th class climbing with a mix of blocky granite climbing and a long crack system in an open book. Once above about the 1,500 ft elevation., the slope lessens significantly to around 45 degrees. What from the bottom looks to be a large crack in the upper section is actually an incredible 2,000 ft long and 3-4 ft. wide rock band that is mostly eroded into the rock wall all the way to the top. This section is made up of 4th and easy 5th class climbing. In places, the rock band is filled with brush and moss, and the climbing can take one out for short distances onto the neighboring low angle faces. If considering this climb, it is good to be aware the reason this section of rock is so clean, is that it is an avalanche zone in the winter, as well as a waterfall when it rains.", "Approach:\u00a0 The first issue is getting to the notch at the shoreline. We used different methods every time, a raft from a 26 ft boat, kayaks from a small excursion vessel, and even a float plane for the successful ascent. We found two ways to approach the ledge at 800 feet where the roped climbing started. To the climbers left, it is a very steep forested slope. Grab trees and work your way up through the steep brush. Once to the ledge traverse to the right. The trees are pretty open in early season, and the brush becomes very thick later in the season. Alternatively this became our standard approach, climb up the gulley/dry waterfall making a few easy 5th class moves where needed until you get to a head wall, then work your way to climbers right and then up steep brushy slopes climbing under or through brush as needed. Keep observant for bears on both sides. We liked to use rubber boots (Ketchikan sneakers) and leather gloves for the approach. Lots of devils club. The ledge at 800 feet is several feet wide in places and can support a tent or two. We have downclimbed the left approach but mostly used a rappel route down the waterfalls. The rappel anchors would not be safe 24 years later.", " The Climb:\u00a0 From the water, you can see what appears to be two cracks making a very tall narrow X starting from the ledge at 800 ft. We climbed the left leg of the X, and then the upper left arm of the X. (the right leg and right arm might make an interesting climb.) The notch was in the middle of the X and was reached after 4 pitches. A short pitch of 5.6 climbing was needed to get above the notch and to see the upper wall. We used a standard rack of nuts, and a selection of cams to 3\u201d. There is a long 4\u201d crack in pitch 4 where we used slings on chock stones. A 4\u201d cam could be helpful here. The first 5 pitches have pretty good protection. The gradient lessens for the upper 2,000 ft the wall where the type of climbing changes with a 4th/easy 5th class gulley/rock stairway and not many places for protection. We found this section good for simul climbing. The first 5 pitches were rated 5.6, 5.4, 5.4, 5.6 and 5.6. The crux was found on the 4th pitch, a long sustained 5.6 4\u201d crack in an open book. (fyi I recall simul climbing several feet with a 50m rope to make the notch.)", "The Descent:\u00a0 Our descent anchors would not be safe today 24 years later. We installed a rappel route from the top starting about 100 feet to the climbers right. We ended up with 15 double rope rappels (50m ropes) for the upper wall to the ledge at 800 ft., and 8 shorter rappels down the waterfall route through the approach section. The upper section had several sections of easy 4rth class downclimbing between various rappels. The bolts were 3/8\u201d expansion type bolts 2 for each rappel station, 20+ years later they would be very questionable and the slings in shreds. It would be interesting to see what if anything has survived. There are not a lot of cracks to leave gear behind for the upper 2,000 ft.. The wall has been hiked up from the back side.
