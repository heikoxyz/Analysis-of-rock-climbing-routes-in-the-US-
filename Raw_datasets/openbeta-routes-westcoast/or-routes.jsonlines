P3 is best done as a short traverse/roof pitch to prevent unnecessary drag and/or poor communication between climbers.\u00a0P1 (~5.9): Short pitch. Climb steep bolted face past 3 bolts to ledge, or chimney system to the right on gear. (5.9)P2 (~5.9 or 5.10): Great crack climbing (mostly hand jams; up to 5.9 depending on crack chosen) leads an awkward belay below roof. 2nd pitch variation (5.10, \u00a0gear to 2 inches) climbs crack system to the right and out roof protected by a fixed pin. FA Jim Davis, & Doug Mishler, 1980.P3 (5.10): Cut right from awkward belay out right, clipping one high bolt before pulling the roof with marginal feet. Roof protects with finger-sized gear.\u00a0P4 (5.10+): Head up and left into a steep corner pitch into the roof system. Rock becomes slick, with much yellow-green lichen. Next belay is up and right under the deepest section of the roof above.\u00a0P5 (5.11a): Move out right to pull roof (good holds, but airy...chimney technique recommended), then up and right to gear belay on spacious ledge at the top of a short pinnacle. The roof move is well-protected from below with a sm-med. nut.\u00a0P6 (5.8 PG-13): Moderate but loose climbing leads to bolted alcove anchor at base of offwidth. Nothing memorable on this pitch except considerably worse rock / choss on your way to the gaping offwidth above. The leader should thread the rope carefully to avoid knocking blocks on the follower.\u00a0P7 (5.10+) Climb obvious offwidth (West Chimney) above and left of alcove belay. Piton near base.

Without a snowmobile - prepare for a 15 mile round trip, 14 - 18hrs out with quite a bit of vert gained from Dutchman flats. Can be done in a push or with a bivy.\u00a0This route starts with 2 WI2/3 steps (snow and ice conditions depending) + moderate snow (300ft) up a distinct approach couloir on the North Face of Broken top. This leads you to the 30M crux/money pitch. The pitch - as climbed in April of 2021 - was steep white, aerated ice that made for poor pro but great sticks. It's properties more closely align with alpine ice than your typical water ice. Belay above the curtain on a picket - it is a good idea to belay off of screws below the top if you lack aforementioned picket.\u00a0After savoring the steep ice, make your way up moderate snow climbing in the bowl above the ice. About 600 feet to summit from here. Be wary of avalanche conditions. You can traverse right and descend if you want to skip the summit\u00a0pitches. The snow increases in angle to steep snow right below the summit block. The snow in the N facing gully below the summit block can be loose and unconsolidated at the very top - this can be skipped via a short horrendously crumbly mixed ramp to the right (M3). Rappel W-NW off of the summit, and down climb the NW ridge to a N facing slope which you downclimb to start your traverse East back to your gear at the base of the approach couloir.***History***Cliff Agocs learned about the existence of the ice formation from Pete Keane, a longtime local climber and guide (30+ years). Since at least the 90's a handful of climbers had hiked up there and found it out of condition. \u00a0At least once, the FA was thwarted because of forgotten crampons, but usually it was found to be disconnected at the top.\u00a0He got a look at the line on the way by while guiding the North Face of Broken Top in March that year. It was fat, but it took a few weeks to nail down the time and a partner. \u00a0The day Cliff and Brandon sent, there was a heat wave in Bend and it got over 80 degrees in town, but the shaded ice was in great condition!He called it proper WI4, which has been backed up by every subsequent ascent. Cliff did some research with the local climbers who were known to have looked at it. \u00a0From what he could learn, there was no record of a previous ascent.\u00a0"], "location": ["Obvious approach couloir on the North face.

Belay at the left of two anchors on a long ledge.Pitch 2: C0 Move up an overhanging red face on a bolt ladder into the \"monkey's mouth.\" Belay from the unique angle-iron anchors.Pitch 3: 5.7 Move the belay to the east edge of the cave (mouth). Reach out of the cave and move straight up the face for 25 feet on bolts to a ledge with chains on the \"nose\" boulder. This classic pitch is short but airy. The opening moves have been called \"panic point\" due to the noticeable exposure.Pitch 4: 5.5 Ascend the boulder at the belay and move northward. Step across a small trough and head for the a bolted anchor on the east side of the summit at a ledge.From here is a 4th class jaunt to the true summit.

Take the stunning and free hanging 2 full 60m rope rappel from the nose boulder to the talus below. This is the highlight of the route for many and allows you to also contemplate the insane difficulty of Just Do It. After this double rope rap you can circle back west to the base of the variation or continue up and over the top of the main buttress on the trail.2. Do a short single rope rap back to the cave. Then, take the tyrolean traverse back to the main buttress. (Requires that you fixed a second rope and rapped in from main buttress onto first pitch, trailed rope up to the cave, and know how to actually do a tyrolean (beyond the scope of this description).3.

Talk to anyone who frequents Smith and enjoys multipitch climbing and they'll tell you that they want to do it someday.So go do it!Honestly, it's really not that bad. This route's reputation for being runout is entirely untrue and it's reputation for being choss is only a little bit true. While there are certainly creaky, flaky holds, it's well protected and most(!) of the hard climbing is on excellent stone. That being said, many of the belays are directly in the leader's line of fire, so bring a helmet.P1: 5.6-10a Climb any of the excellent sport routes of the Monument Base Area to the rightmost anchor.P2: 5.9 Step right and then up to gain an obvious left-facing corner. The flakes in the corner sound hollow, but you're clipping shiny bolts. Hand traverse left (good gear) to two separate anchors. Of the two, we used the left one, but I'd recommend the right. (it's just a touch further out from under the line of fire and is in better rock) Pitches 1 and 2 are easily linked.P3: \"5.11-\" (to quote the Watts guide) I\u2019d peg it more around 11+. This is where things start getting interesting. Work up and left to a distinct crux at an asca bolt out left. \u00a0Execute a thin, off-balance sequence on sidepulls and edges to a rail up and left and then work back right to another asca bolt higher up. \u00a0If you clip either of the two bolts to the right, (before the aforementioned 2nd asca bolt, more in line with the original bolt ladder) make sure to use long slings. \u00a0Once established in the chimney, wade through some easy choss until just below an old, manky anchor. \u00a0From here either continue left up the original line of terrible old bolts in choss (not recommended, 9+/10-) or step right to ledge with a less old anchor., but don't stop and belay. \u00a0Instead climb up much better rock just left of a blunt arete clipping more new asca bolts before running it out on easy ground to the top. \u00a0(recommended, 10-)P4 5.12- Moderate climbing up less than perfect rock past more ancient bolts (easily backed up with gear and newer bolts) spits you off at a nice stance below a steep swath of vastly better rock. Gymnastic and balancy moves on some booming flakes deposit you at the crux. After pulling through the difficulties onto the ledge, catch your breath (don't belay) and climb further up and right clipping shiny new bolts as you pull exciting moves in one of Smith's more airy positions. Belay at either of the anchors at the base of the Tombstone crack. (can't miss it)P5: 5.10+ Pull a thin face move to gain the start of the splitter. It starts as fingers and gradually widens up to hands. Power through the fingers/off-fingers down low and savor the amazing (but kind of sharp) jamming above. Belay at a large, obvious ledge.P6: 5.6 Climb up and left following an obvious weakness that will ultimately corkscrew up to the summit. Watch out for rope drag.Descent: The whole route rappels easily. Anchors are down and east of the summit. We used two ropes, but there are rumors of a single 70 being sufficient.

As the first 5.14a in North America, this route's haughty grade focused national attention on local tactics, while luring the world's elite free-climbers to an unknown backwater rest-stop in rural Oregon.  Perhaps more than any other route of the era, To Bolt demonstrated the unique benefits of the \"top-down\" approach.  If nothing else, surely this was a route worth hang-dogging for. ", "  For more than 20 years, hardmen from around the world have tangled with To Bolt's tiny crimps since French patron \"JB\" Tribout first freed the line in late 1986.  Alan Watts, the Father of American Sport Climbing, once posited that virtually every elite climber of the last 20 years had attempted the line, or had at least contemplated it, and thought better of it.  Scott Franklin, Jerrry Moffat, Ron Kauk, Alan Watts, Doug Englekirk, Steve Schneider, Lynn Hill, Chris Sharma, Dave Graham, Tommy Caldwell, Beth Rodden, Sonny Trotter, Steve McClure...the list of folks who've ticked this wall reads like a Who's Who of free climbing. ", "  In addition to its intriguing history, unparalleled movement, flawless golden tuff and an awe-inspiring appearance warrant the line's ultra-classic status.   ", "  For the redpoint climber, To Bolt offers countless challenges.  With so many difficult moves, numerous factors must come together for the send.  Weather, shoes, fitness, skin, where & when to rest, and how to clip--all these come into play.  The route is perhaps as much a psychological challenge as a physical one, with the redpoint crux coming down to the climber's ability to keep focus over the last five bolts of relatively easier stone, and suppress the leg-rattling notion that the send is in the bag. ", "  The route begins tamely enough, with 3 bolts of fairly mellow 5.12- liebacking up a series of left-facing sidepulls.  There is a difficult left-hand mono move below the first bolt, and an easy sinker mono for the right-hand at the 3rd bolt.  The first difficult clip comes at the fourth bolt, just before the first crux, a 5.12 rightward traverse on sharp, purple crimps and un-inspiring foot divots.  Opposing sidepulls and high-steps lead to a 1/4\" polished crimp and the tenuous fifth clip.  The real business comes in the next few bolts.  For crux #2, gaston up and left to a series of 5.13- deadpoints to thin, sharp crimps and a core intensive clipping stance.  Clip #6, chalk up and kiss your skin goodbye as you tickle the 1/8\" crimps of the next 5.13 crux.  Moving from 6 to 7 is the hardest bit of climbing, and it comes with a  considerable pump, but good balance is the key to reaching the sickle-shaped sidepull and an extremely insecure clipping stance.  A brief shake & chalk is possible here, before continuing thru crux #4 via sequential 5.12-ish footwork & hip shifting.  Clip the 8th bolt with ease, then a series of super-high-steps and long lockoffs lead to the ninth bolt and the first real rest: a rounded 1\" crimp with decent feet.   ", "  After a good shake, beta-intensive 5.13- crux #5 heads up and left on rounded crimps and long cranks, to a slopey pod rest at the tenth bolt.  From here to the chains is considered 5.12d, but should not be underestimated, as there are many heart-breaking moves in the last 5 bolts.  A few moderate moves lead to a large bear-hug flake at the 11th bolt, and one final shake before the last 5.12/13- crux.  Delicate footwork and tiny crimps work up & left to the \"crescent-shaped\" hold, an awkward clip and one last hard crank to a series of horizontal crack pods.  From here, things ease somewhat as the pump builds.  Long sequential lockoffs between bigger holds with better feet keep things moving chain-ward, but don't allow for any real \"Thank-God\" rest.  After clipping 14, an awkward & balancey step left leads to an ascending leftward traverse, crossing delicately to large slopey pockets and a bomber clipping jug on the arete.

Minimize rope drag at the beginning because the climbing turns into runout 5.6 to the \"anchors\" (the big yellow Smith guidebook says there are anchors) which is an old (1/4\") bolt w/ a thin hanger.

Bottom line is, this is one climb that the Smith guidebook's description is lacking, though understandable since it isn't climbed often due to the poor quality of rock. Be prepared to build anchors (not something most at Smith tend to do) and wear a helmet because you and your partner will be kicking rocks and pebbles down the whole time. I'm pretty sure you could rap from the top of the second pitch, which is only maybe 60' feet long, with two 70' m, but since we rapped from the top of the first pitch with two 70's, and there was plenty of rope on the ground, I can only make an intelligent guess on that one.

Follow the climbers trail uphill onto the ridge proper then traverse the ridge uphill towards the summit plug. The trail is easy to follow and you don't need or really want to rope up till the traverse about 250 vertical feet below the summit, at this point most will rope up for the very low 5th class traverse that has some good exposure on the east side. On the traversing pitch there are two fixed pins for you to clip and the rest of the reliable protection comes from slung horns for your belays, this can be done as one or two pitches depending on rope length, 70m required to do as one. Next head up a short scree slope towards the summit plug and then encounter a short chimney/water runnel, head up the steep (5.2) chimney towards you next belay station (a slung horn) and set another belay here. At this point the rock quality improves and if you aren't unnerved by 3000 foot exposure then a short easy scramble will take you to the summit, for those without nerves of steel you can rope up for a very short, and surprisingly enough, well protected pitch to the summit. There is a slung horn on the summit to rappel back to the top of the chimney pitch.

The last time I climbed it, my climbing partner, Paige, and I had a very fun and rewarding climb.Route: With the exceptions of the starting dihedral and a \u0093V\u0094-chimney on the summit massif there are multiple variations to each pitch. The climb can be divided into three distinct parts:Part 1: Two or three pitches of reasonable climbing up to 5.8 to get to the notch and then up a gully.First, a short pitch to get to the notch. There are three ways of doing this (two from the north side and one on the south side):1. North side \u0093rope drag\u0094 5.4: From the alcove climb easy rock to the right and circle around to the notch.2. North side \u0093direct\u0094 5.7/8: From the alcove climb short vertical cracks leading slightly right of the notch.3. From the south side 4th class slabs lead to the notch.Once at the notch traverse on the south side for about 10-15 feet to a dihedral. At 5.8 the dihedral may be the crux of the climb. After the dihedral, easy climbing leads up to the crest of the ridge. Near the top enter a low angle shallow gully. Climb the simple low angle gully to its top. The gully is the steepest section of the loose \u0093Cascade Dinner Plates\u0094. With careful scrambling the dinner plates are not bad.Part 2: The next 250 feet or so is easy climbing on the low angle ridge crest. This section contains more loose dinner plates, but again not dangerously so. This section ends at the base of the summit massif.Part 3: The final section is four or so pitches. For the most part, the rock of this section is solid and it is not until the final ridge walk that you encounter much loose rock.About 80 feet up from the base of the summit massif is a short, 20' \u0093V\u0094-chimney.

There are currently 5 distinct and separate moderate trad routes here, and 3 more slight variations of the 5. They all go between 5.8 and 5.10. Only 2 of them have names. On the far left, as you start up the 4th class which goes to the top, is the obvious crack \"Corona Glass Houses\", 5.10- named by Bryan Schmidt after he and I did the FA. The other routes it's nice to have a 70M rope. I noticed that my blue Mammut 60m JUST reached the deck on the right side, then came back a year later and the identical rope ends were over 15' short one each end! (Lots of use in that rope in a year, water and washing will shirk them that much) So watch your rope ends! ", "  The 2nd line is slightly down the hill and starts just left of the fir tree. It can be finished 2 ways. Left @ slightly over the 1/2 way mark into a wide crack (#7 or 8 hex is bomber at the start of the wide stuff)- or just continue straight up the obvious crack, still a bit dirty but getting cleaner - and harder.

My route starts @ 5 feet left of Mikes route. Later the line below was cleaned off and added so Dream Weaver can finally be done ground up as well. Like all of the routes on the Buttress, that start has evolved: from originally grabbing a clump of sword ferns, then grabbing a nice rock hold revealed when the Sword fern finally got pulled off, to now a difficult start and possibly the crux for the 2 routes on the right when the nice hold got yanked off.

If you are leading, be aware that the loose nature of the area may mean that your perfect looking protection may pull right out as that huge block simply shifts when you fall. So overprotection is encouraged, and if your partner grief's you out over how slow you're going, you know which finger to utilize to non-verbally explain your position and your thoughts:-) There had been a perfect fingercrack in the upper part of the middle route which simply disappeared when the 300 + lb block fell off, making that route significantly more difficult.

Not even knowing and still not knowing where the actual route went made it basically a first ascent in its own right.

The technical crux; Right hand clips are the order of the day (much harder, and very much dirtier, otherwise).   P4: 5.7, 7 bolts. An enjoyable, easy, and well bolted pitch.   --- The climbing gets more alpine above here   P5: 5.7, 3 bolts. Some 20 feet up, bolts with black hangers appear. After the third eases your nerves, shuffle left. A trad placement before one last nontrivial move will ease nerves.   P6: 5.8, 6 bolts. Your choice, up over or around under the boulder. Left, then up. Long slings help with drag. It is easy to miss the P6 anchor if you don't already know where it is.
