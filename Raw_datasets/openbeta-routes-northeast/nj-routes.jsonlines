Near the top of the chimney you'll find good edges on your right (your right as you face out of the chimney) side to transition out and around onto the arete, which is 5ft out of your reach. It may seem overhanging to make this reach, but there is a nice spot for your foot on that arete once you commit out to the arete and good small fingers.
