It has two distinct and great cruxes, wonderful face climbing, a short but relatively splitter crack, a juggy roof and some sequency crimping.  I'm a little uncertain as to whether the rest of the Western, MA climbing community would agree with me about how classic I think this route is (it was one of my first 5.10's so I'm biased) but I'll let you make up your own minds.           The climb starts in the obvious finger crack just to the left of the big left facing corner in the middle of the Tennessee wall (the Guillotine).  After climbing this crack to a large ledge you can rest and chat with your belayer before the first crux.  Follow the chalk above your head (really fun sequence) until you've gained a stance involving a small flake and edges for feet.  Then some easy climbing leads you to the roof on your left and crux #2.  A reachy move past the roof leads to a jug, from which you can gain a good crimp and pull the roof on smeary feet.
