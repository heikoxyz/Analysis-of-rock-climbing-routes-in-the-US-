Well, I was close but not correct. According to a guy who was there when Henry Barber put up his route and named it, the actual line is right around the corner from this one. So, this route here will go back to the only name I had for it which was what I called it after sending it clean for the first time. I projected it back in 2014 with Brandon Kotulka. He couldn't finish the project so I worked it alone till I got it. Thanks Brandon for the beginning beta!Like High 5, this is also essentially a high-ball boulder problem. However the real problem is, if you come off the crux, even a big stack of Organic\u2019s pads aren\u2019t going to save you - you\u2019re going to be hurt, really hurt. The beginning is an easy .6 walk up to the beginning of the crux - pulling the ar\u00eate of a huge overhanging roof. The way I get to that is to run along a horizontal rail with my hands to the rounded-off end of that. With my foot jammed in under the roof for stability, I reach out far right and grab the nose. Then I unlock my foot and am free hanging by my hands. I lock a right foot in under the nose and the next move is key - a right hand deadpoint to a semi-vertical rail \u00be the way up the ar\u00eate. Hand placement here is crucial! Miss it by just an inch or two and you\u2019re off - completely off. Nail it, and you then get a left foot on the wall in front of you and reach up with a high left to the same ar\u00eate rail. This part is bomber and on about a 45 degree slope. Hit that and you can then pretty much stand up and then mantle up on top. That\u2019s it really. The rest is like 5.6 again up two stacked little walls. Top out there and you can be lowered if you want.Now, if you REALLY want some fun - try The Leap of Faith! When you get to the top of the second stack, turn around and look at the massive rock roof that\u2019s above The Flake. You will see the same \u201cchicken head\u201d that you use to pull that roof on that route. Stand at the edge where you are and jump across the 40ft chasm and lock on to the chicken head with both hands! Don\u2019t worry, if you miss, you\u2019re fine - you\u2019re on top rope and you\u2019ll be like Superman. If/when you nail it, let both feet swing once and then use that momentum to pull up and engage them to the rock. Then reach with a high left to another head and pull yourself up and on top!

Especially now that it\u2019s sport! Sure you can still top rope it but now you not only up your game, you eliminate the wicked swing if you come off. The 10+ rating is based on leading it. I would say it's more like 9+ on top rope fyi.The main route is the same - sport or TR, the only real variation is at the start. When I was first doing this route I was instructed to go up the right side of the gully, up on a broad platform, then proceed to the skinny platform (what I like to call \u201cthe plank\u201d) against the face. The problem is, that first platform gets super dirty because of debris washing down the gully that dirties your hands and shoes. Not good for the next phase which happens to be the crux. I now start where the bolt line is and proceed up on clean rock avoiding the dirty platform altogether. This also sets me up to pull up and over the plank which I enjoy. Once on the plank, just spin around and get ready for the fun part!Without getting too detailed, the premise of this section is to reach up to that diagonal flake (aka rail) above your head, and go hand-over-hand up it while working your feet between the face and the ar\u00eate. The key to begin all this is mostly nerves. If you can let your mind go free and focus on the moves, you can release yourself from the plank and smoothly go into lay back mode and Git r Done. Pulling up to the last move to gain the top of this section is tough but you\u2019ll figure it out. Hint: look for the awesome heal-hook on the ar\u00eate near bolt five.The next big phase could be considered a crux and is my favorite part - engaging and pulling the gigantic roof that looms over this entire bottom section. Again, I won\u2019t go into detail so you can discover it for yourself, but there are holds above the roof that are bomber! After that, it\u2019s a breeze to the anchors and a good stance while there.

This is a bit tricky but the secret is feet - stemming between the opposing walls into small pockets. Hands are few so take what you can get. The second bolt is near the top of the crux and offers good protection from the platform ledge. Beyond that, it\u2019s an easy walk up through the inside dihedral of the gully.

You don't really want to take him, but you kind of feel like you have to give him a chance at least.  So you show up on Saturday with all your gear eager to get some climbing in.  Of course Joe's standing there in his athletic shoes.  Plus Joe has a slightly American physique and relationship with food, health, and fitness.  Also, Joe hasn't done a pull up in years.  Still, Joe is tough and everyone starts somewhere.  Perhaps this could be the beginning of something new. ", "  Unfortunately, juat like every Saturday there is a line forming at Beginner Face.  You Name It just came open, but that can be quite tricky without a little technique and proper shoes.  In fact pretty much the only route a total beginner in athletic shoes might be able to climb is Beginner Face which is why there's now a 3 hour wait for it. ", "  Suddenly you think, \"Hey, let's rappel while we wait.  It's fun and kind of rock climby.  Doesn't need special shoes.  And a climber needs to know how to rappel eventually anyway.\" ", "  So you set up the nice big overhanging rappel for Joe.  You connect up his ATC, wrap up his auto block, and then tell him to just lean back into that 40 feet of open space.  \"Don't worry, you can't fall, just don't let go with that right hand!\" ", "  Joe's looking at you with wide eyes and letting go of the rope to cling to the rock even though you just told him to never let go of the rope.  You realize that a big overhanging rappel might be a little bit too much too soon.  Maybe you just need to get in line for the Beginner Face.  You've done it 1000 times, but it is the only Rim Road climb a completely inexperienced climber in athletic shoes even has a shot at.  Or is it??? ", "  As you're standing around near the Beginner Face you spot another line.  Someone could scramble the chimney 20 feet to the right of the Beginner Face, up to a big wide ledge.  From that ledge it might be possible to climb a short face and top out on top of the Beginner Block.  It looks possible...  maybe even in athletic shoes. ", "  So you run up top, jump the gap, set up an anchor, jump back across the gap, run back down again and voila...  You have an alternate beginner route established. Joe can climb the chimney to the ledge at least.  Maybe he can even make it all the way up and out in his athletic shoes.  Plus the wide ledge half way up the climb offers a great place to teach someone how to rappel.  With the ropes hanging from above, transition onto a rappel is a breeze. ", "  So much more than the cobbled together mess that is might seem to be, The Total Newbs Climbing and Rappelling Training Route offers an alternative to the always busy Beginners Face.  Then there are those folks who find even the 5.4 Beginners Face a little tricky or exposed.  This alternative route offers many starting options and can be climbed quite easily up to the ledge, even by beginners in athletic shoes.  Being largely in a chimney adds that false sense of security which nervous new climbers crave.  Once on the ledge you have a perfect place from which to practice rapelling techniques.  Or the bold new climber can take a shot at the second half. ", "  This route can in fact be climbed all the way in tennis shoes.  However above the ledge there are a few tricky moves and sketchy moments that earn the route a 5.5 overall grade.  Up to the ledge it is a 5.2 or 5.3, above the ledge is solid 5.5, noticeably more interesting than the 5.4 Beginner Face just to its left. ", "  While the chimney on the lower half offers easy lines, as you progress out around the left arete and onto the main rock face some interesting and more challenging lines can be explored using the same top rope set up.  You essentially get to protected boulder on the arete and main face, while Joe gets to climb and rappel at a modest grade."], "location": ["On the far right edge of Beginners Face there is a chimney.

", "  Once up the chimney, transition onto the large ledge halfway up the far right side of Beginners Face.  From here rappel down or finish the face up and slightly right to claim a 5.5 climb. ", "  While children and total newbs scramble in the chimney, use your turn on top rope to try climbing directly up the arete on the left side of the chimney.  If that is too easy try climbing directly up the main rock face, touching but not crossing the arete.  If that is too easy, try climbing directly up the main face without using any holds on the arete at all.  If you move left about 8 to 10 feet on the main face you run into a 5.8-5.9 climb listed elsewhere as Squids in Bondage.  The point is that while you have someone playing in the chimney and learning to rappel, you can try out many different, harder variations using the same top rope set up.

This problem has it all: history, a striking feature, adequate holds, height, continuity of movement and a bit of spice! ", "  The Jugarete can be climbed two ways.  The right (direct) way is to hop up to the wide horizontal rail on the hanging arete and slap up to two small finger bumps at the lip of the beach ball slab above while squeezing the arete with your feet or using a tiny chip to keep the feet from swinging off.  Claw your way blindly up to a crimp edge or two mid way up the bulge.  Get your feet underneath you on the starting rail and mantel with your heart in your throat.  This way is V5 or perhaps a tad harder, but probably not V6.  This is a standard sandbag at the Stables.  It would be prudent to get on top of the boulder and locate and chalk the holds prior to launching off, and the holds are hard to see. ", "  The left version of Jugarete is to hop up to the rail, get the bumps at the lip of the slab, and then start working the hands left along the rising sloping lip rather than topping out directly above.  After slapping away left, you will end up with the left hand on a sloper and the right on a faint edge on the sloping lip.  There is a foothold far below on the face that may be used if you are lengthy.  Get the right foot up as a toe perch or heel hook and mantel, again in terror.  The intended problem is to not traverse all the way left into the huge horizontal jug that is at the top of the Juggernaut dihedral crack, though in theory this is possible.  This variation is about V6, but probably not V7.  Both ways of doing this problem are high quality and climb quite well.  ", "  The Jugarete traverse sit starts with hands on a huge plate on the overhanging wall eight feet to the right of the arete.  This is the start to Huck (V4).

Technical, physical, involved and committing, this problem embodies everything of Mount Gretna and the rock type.  The sit start to the Prow is my all time favorite diabase boulder problem out of all areas in Pennsylvania, a state I was born in and never left until the age of 20.  I grew up on Mount Gretna Road, just a ten minute drive from the main boulder field.  I have a special connection with this problem. The stand start at a stiff V5 was one of my first V5's.  I completed the sit start to The Prow on April 1, 2003.  I remember that day vividly.  It was one of the first advanced boulder problems I had ever completed, both mentally and physically.

The stand start is a sandbag or solid at the grade at V5.  Right hand up anywhere you want on the arete, scrunch up, and highstep onto the blade.  The right foot will be smearing on a downsloping feature, if it blows you will graze your shin on the underside of the roof.  A large deadpoint for a one pad left hand sidepull immediately follows.  It is the largest hold on the problem but is utilized for a very short period of time.  Delicately balance your way around the right arete after more slapping, 1/3 pad sidepulls and a high right foot smear.  There are at least three ways to get to the lip; technical and in control, shouldery and barndoorish, or all out dyno.  I prefer the former.   ", "  For the full V7 or V8 sit start line that nearly doubles the length and quality of the problem, start underneath the roof blade in a true sit start and work around left on solid, almost one pad crimps.

The name comes from holds breaking on the upper half after the first ascent, which required an adjustment in movement and beta and how to use the new and different handholds.  The sequences and handholds went through changes for the first couple of years.  Today, and for the last nine years or so, everything has stayed solid.   ", "  Begin by sit starting with your butt on the ground or on a single pad.  The right hand is in a large, incut triangular tooth down low and the left hand on a gaston three-quarter pad edge.  The starting footholds are large and flat, especially for diabase.  The hips should be in close to the wall.  Pull on and rock up hard on the right foot to grasp the main hold of the climb; a gaston that is held with the right hand and contains a contorted thumb catch underneath. ", "  Perch the right foot on the right hand starting tooth and shove in a marginal right knee scum beneath the diagonal roof to keep you in close to the wall for when you release a handhold.  Bump the left hand to a undercling on the roof feature with the elbow sticking straight up.  Shift the right foot up a few inches to a good foothold.  Release the right hand from the gaston to reach the right hand again high to a sloping edge feature.  The middle, index and pinky fingers should go on a three finger tiny diagonal crimp that lies over a subtle sloper, while the index finger alone grabs a tiny edge that faces  diagonally but at a 90 degree angle change from the other fingers, kind of like a star.   ", "  Keep tension and reach the left hand to a broken, third pad left facing sidepull edge with a bit of an incut.  This hold is one of those that broke, but what is left now is fairly solid and good.  Stand up high and run the feet up and left a bit so you can bust the right hand to the good flat lip.  From here it is over, get the left hand up to a hold just beneath the lip and mantel with the right leg.   ", "  The whole idea of this bloc is tension.  The holds are poor and none of the moves are particularly long.  It is just about making intermediate movements between bad holds that all face the wrong way.

", "  All in all, this is a cool problem and you will feel great if you can figure it out.  It seems so simple upon first glance, but is much more difficult than it appears.
