Back in those days some of us were interested in training for Yosemite's \"Big walls\", so we practiced aid climbing where we could. It was during the 2nd aid ascent that apparently the leader found the nailing too committing, and so drilled a bolt before doing the last few \"Rurp\" placements. After completing this 2nd ascent, he then thought better of it, and rappelled down and chopped the offending bolt. Sometime later, this same climber decided the route could go free, but wanted a bolt, right where he had chopped the first one. To his credit, he drilled that 2nd bolt free and on the lead. It just goes to show, sometimes all this bolt stuff is not as cut and dried as some fundamentalists would have you believe.
