**Goal of this project**

This project is aiming to get first hand experience using more complex databasets and Python-mediated data analysis.
@vnugent was so kind to extract data of rock climbing routes from various US states of the website MountainProject.

Within this projects I want to ask questions related to rock climbing in the US. 
Firstly this personal project is used to apply data wrangling and cleaning tasks to obtain a workable final output for analysis.

**The following questions and tasks about the dataset will be adressed and solved** 

**Data Wrangling/Data**
Does openbeta-usa-routes-aug-2020.zip contain all the data that is found in the .zip files of specific areas?
Compare Mountain2.zip and Mountains2.zip. Which dataset is more complete? Are they similar? 
Which routes can not be found in one or the other dataset?
Split the grade column into seperate columns for each grading system
Create seperate tables for the various types of climbs. 
Proceed with the analysis of the routes of type: sport

-> This will be reported in code and comments therein (data_preparation.ipyub).

**The following questions about the dataset will get answered**

**Data analysis**
The distribution of sport climbing routes across states by grade.
     Which state has the hardes sport climbing routes (most routes >=8a)?
     How many hard grades (>= 9a) are there in the states?
     Which state has the most sport climbing routes?
     Since trad climbing is very common in the US, which state has the most trad routes?
     Which state has the most sport climbing routes relative to all types of climbing?
     What style of climbing is mostly found in each state in relative terms?
For a more fair/relevant comparison, lets consider state area:
Which state has the most dense distribution of sport routes?
