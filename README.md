**Goal of this project**

This project is aiming to get first hand experience using databases, SQL queries and Python-mediated data analysis.
@vnugent was so kind to extract data about rock climbing groutes from various US states from the website MountainProject.

Within this projects I want to ask various questions related to climbing in the US. 
Firstly the dataset will be made available for online SQL querries. Then the data will be extracted cleaned and structured.

**The following questions about the data will get answered:**

**Data Wrangling/Data**
Does openbeta-usa-routes-aug-2020.zip contain all the data that is found in the .zip files of specific areas?
Which routes can not be found in one or the other dataset?
Split the grade column into seperate columns for each grading system
Create seperate tables for the various types of climbs. 
Proceed with the analysis of the routes of type: sport

**Data analysis**
How many sport routes exist in each data set/region?
Which region has the highest ratio of sport type routes compared to others?
What does the spread of grades look like across the regions and the US?
Which region has the hardest grades?
